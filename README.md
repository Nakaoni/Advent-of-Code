# Advent-of-Code

Repository containing the history of Advent of Code journey

## 2024

The goal is to get familiar with Java. <br> 
I have never really completely deep dive into it.
I will take this AoC 2024 opportunity to, at least, use and (re)learn Java.

According to New Relic's annual State of Java Ecosystem report, the version 17 is the most used, therefore, I will code in Java 17.

Stack:
- Java version: 17
- Build system: Makefile (I will not use Maven or Gradle as I want to learn from scratch first)
- Testing framework: jUnit5

### Settings

- Classpath:
    - 2024/main
    - 2024/test
